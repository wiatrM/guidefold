# Where to hunt and how to report

## Where to Hunt

Sweep for these seams — each is a known class of genuine opportunity:

**Feedback gaps**
- Pressable elements with no `:active` state → `transform: scale(0.97)` with `transition: transform 160ms ease-out` (subtle: 0.95–0.98)
- Destructive actions confirmed with a plain click where a hold-to-confirm fill would prevent slips → `clip-path: inset(0 100% 0 0)` overlay, 2s linear on press, 200ms ease-out snap-back on release

**Teleporting state**
- Content that swaps, appears, or vanishes instantly (conditional renders, route content, expanding sections) → fade/scale entrances from `scale(0.95–0.97)` + `opacity: 0`, `ease-out`, never `scale(0)`; `@starting-style` for entry without JS
- Accordions/collapses that snap open → height + opacity transition
- List items added/removed with no bridge (and the list isn't high-frequency) → enter/exit transitions; CSS transitions, not keyframes, so rapid triggers retarget smoothly

**Missing spatial story**
- Panels, popovers, menus that appear with no connection to their trigger → scale in with `transform-origin` at the trigger (Base UI: `var(--transform-origin)`); modals are exempt — they stay centered
- Dismissable surfaces (toasts, sheets) that exit a different way than they entered → symmetric paths; `translateY(100%)` percentages, not hardcoded pixels

**Group entrances**
- A grid or list that pops in all at once on a page users see occasionally → 30–80ms stagger; decorative, must never block interaction

**Gesture seams**
- Draggable/swipeable elements that snap with no physics → springs (`{ type: "spring", duration: 0.5, bounce: 0.2 }`, bounce 0.1–0.3), velocity-based dismissal (`Math.abs(distance)/elapsedMs > ~0.11`), rubber-banding at boundaries instead of hard stops

**The delight budget**
- Rare, high-emotion moments rendered flat — first-run, empty states, success/completion, celebration. These are the only places bounce, stagger generosity, or a longer beat are welcome.

Useful sweeps: grep for conditional renders with no transition (`{isOpen &&`, `display: none` toggles), `onClick` handlers on elements with no `:active`/transition styles, `details`/accordion markup, drag handlers, `.map(` renders of entering lists, empty-state and success components.

## Workflow

1. **Recon.** Identify the stack, motion libraries, existing easing/duration tokens (suggestions must extend these, not invent parallel ones), and the product's personality — a crisp dashboard earns fewer and subtler suggestions than a playful consumer app. Build a rough frequency map of the surfaces you'll judge.
2. **Sweep** the hunt list above. Done when every seam class has either yielded candidates with `file:line` evidence or been explicitly cleared.
3. **Gate** every candidate through all four questions. Be ruthless.
4. **Report** in the format below. If nothing survives, say so plainly; that's a good result, not a failure.

## Required Output Format

### Part 1 — Opportunities table

One row per surviving suggestion, ordered by leverage:

| # | Location | Today | Purpose | Frequency | Suggested motion |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `Toast.tsx:41` | New toasts appear instantly | Preventing a jarring change | Occasional | Enter via `@starting-style`: `opacity: 0; translateY(100%)` → settled, `transition: 400ms ease`, exit same edge |
| 2 | `Button.tsx:18` | No press feedback | Feedback | Tens/day | `:active { transform: scale(0.97) }`, `transition: transform 160ms ease-out` — subtle enough for the frequency tier |

Every "Suggested motion" cell carries exact values — the curve, the duration, the properties — pulled from this repo's shared vocabulary (`--ease-out: cubic-bezier(0.23, 1, 0.32, 1)`, `--ease-in-out: cubic-bezier(0.77, 0, 0.175, 1)`, `--ease-drawer: cubic-bezier(0.32, 0.72, 0, 1)`), never approximated. Animate `transform` and `opacity` only; include reduced-motion handling (gentler, not zero) and `@media (hover: hover) and (pointer: fine)` gating when the suggestion involves hover.

### Part 2 — Rejected candidates (REQUIRED)

List 2–5 places you considered and deliberately did **not** suggest, each with the gate question that killed it:

- `CommandMenu.tsx:12` — command palette open/close. **Rejected: keyboard-initiated, 100+/day. Never animate.**
- `Chart.tsx:88` — animated line drawing on the analytics graph. **Rejected: functional data the user is reading; decoration hinders.**

This section is what separates this skill from an animation wishlist.

### Part 3 — Verdict

One short paragraph: how much motion this interface actually needs, whether it's already close to right, and which single suggestion has the highest leverage. Close by pointing at the handoff: `improve-animations plan <suggestion>` to turn any row into a self-contained implementation plan.

## Tone

When feel can't be judged from code alone, say so instead of guessing. The goal is an interface people will happily use every day — and daily use argues for less motion, not more.
